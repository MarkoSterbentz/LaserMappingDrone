The compressed examples file HDF5Examples-0.1.1-Source.tar.gz, located in the 
HDF5 install folder, can be built and tested with CMake and the supplied
HDF518_Examples.cmake file. The HDF518_Examples.cmake expects HDF5 to have
been installed in the default location with above compilers.

    Create a directory to run the examples.
    Copy HDF5Examples-0.1.1-Source.tar.gz to this directory, do NOT unzip.
    Copy HDF518_Examples.cmake to this directory.
    Edit HDF518_Examples.cmake line 8 to set INSTALLDIR to where HDF5 is installed.
    Execute from this directory: 
        ctest -S HDF518_Examples.cmake,HDF5Examples-0.1.1-Source -C Release -O test.log

When executed, the ctest script will save the results to the log file, test.log, as
