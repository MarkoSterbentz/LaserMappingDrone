What libraries/programs (may) need to be installed?
	Note: I had a clean build of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, so I had to install a lot. Your mileage may vary. Also, I cannot guarantee that this list is complete, or completely necessary. If there are errors, you will need to install the appropriate library. So, here's what I found that I (may have) needed:

	cmake
	flex
	bison
	zlib1g.dev
	libbz2-dev
	python2.7-dev
	install PythonLibs
	python-dev
	libboost-all-dev
	libxt-dev
	qt4 (specifically qt 4.8.6)

What was the Cmake version used?
	cmake version 3.2.2

Where is the makefile created?
	The makefile is created within "VeloView-master/build"

BUILD DIRECTIONS:
Note: I used GCC Version 4.8.4.
Note: It can take upwards of 40 minutes to build, and requires an internet connection for downloading the libraries. Use make flags like "make -j4" to speed up build time.

0. Clone the project from github
1. Make the build directory (mkdir build)
2. Go into build directory
3. Run "cmake -DENABLE_veloview:BOOL=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_qt:BOOL=ON  -DUSE_SYSTEM_python=ON ../Superbuild/" in order to create the build files.
4. Run make. Fix missing library issues as necessary.
5. You'll encounter an Boost compatability issues when building liblas. Fix Boost compatability issues:
	- navigate to "build/liblas/src/liblas/src/classification.cpp"
	- find all instances of "uint64_t" (there should only be 2), and change them to "boost::uint64_t"
6. Run make again.
